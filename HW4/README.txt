 * FindShortestRoadPath class that will perform
 * Dijkstra's Algorithm on the file
 * 
 * In order to run typing commandline:
 * 
 * java FindShortestRoadPath {file}.gr sourceID targetID {outputfile}.txt
 * 	this command will create a file contains the distance and the path from 
 * 	the sourceID to the targetID
 * 
 * To see the actual graph type in commandline:
 * 	java FindShortestRoadPath {file}.gr sourceID targetID {file}.co savedCoord.txt
 * Open Geocoding Map.html and the path will load directly on the map
 *
 * Note: {file} is the name of the file
 * 	 If the path is not loaded, hit Ctrl-R to reload 
 *       The name savedCoord.txt is fixed
 *       Geocoding Map.html can be re-run by whening hitting Ctrl-R
